Partial implementation of Quine-McCluskey method. 

clang :

    This folder contains implementation in c-language.

    To run,  
      $ make
    
    If will generate qn.bin file which you can run from terminal.
      $ ./qn.bin 

    Header file globals.h contains definition of data-structure. Please do not
    change definition of this data-structure without notifying the TA. He has to
    write test-scripts.

    Doubts and queries must be posted on Q/A forum on moodle. 

    You can write your implementation from scratch. In that case, TAs may ask
    you to appear for a viva and demo. It is hard to read other people code.
